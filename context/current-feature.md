- 2026-10-15: Added the Drizzle + Neon PostgreSQL schema and initial development migration.
- 2026-10-15: Refactored the Drizzle schema into domain modules with co-located relations, preserving the SQL schema and relational query API; verified build, lint, types, and zero migration drift.
- 2026-10-15: Added NextAuth v5 GitHub OAuth with the Drizzle adapter, JWT sessions, session user IDs, and protected dashboard routes; verified build, lint, types, eight HTTP checks, production host setup, independent review, and user-confirmed sign-in/sign-out with repeat-login ID retention.
- 2026-10-15: Added validated email/password registration and Credentials sign-in with bcryptjs, preserving GitHub OAuth and JWT user IDs; fixed case-variant account selection and a Tailwind/Turbopack dashboard reload loop. Verified build, lint, types, 43 HTTP checks, watcher/browser regressions, and user-confirmed GitHub repeat-login ID retention.
- 2026-10-15: Added custom sign-in/registration pages and a responsive sidebar account dropdown with reusable image/initials avatar. Verified build, lint, types, 164 initial browser assertions, 93 post-review/post-merge assertions, independent reviews, and user-confirmed GitHub/credentials acceptance. Deferred inline recovery for interrupted sign-in requests.
- 2026-10-16: Added Resend registration verification with hashed 24-hour single-use links, atomic verification, 60-second resend cooldown, neutral recovery responses, configurable automatic verification, and silent disabled-page redirects. Added development-only demo-preserving user cleanup with dry-run default. Verified build, lint, types, zero migration drift, 61 backend checks, 27 browser checks, 15 simulated cleanup safety checks, and independent reviews. Mail transport was stubbed; real inbox delivery, full live GitHub OAuth, and live cleanup execution remain unverified. Deferred minor: Resend SDK provider-error logging in development. Implementation and evidence: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-15-email-verification-on-registration.md.
- 2026-10-16: Added forgot-password recovery with hashed 24-hour single-use tokens, pending/ready delivery gating, neutral recovery responses, Resend email delivery, accessible forgot/reset pages, sign-in integration, token-history/referrer protections, and controlled failure handling. Applied migrations 0002 and 0003 only to development branch `ep-silent-bird-b59kwhec`. Verified lifecycle/action/page/integration checks, development-fixture pending/ready/replay behavior with original hash restoration, review regressions, lint, build, TypeScript, no schema drift, and clean runtime shutdown. Real inbox delivery, global/IP throttling, and callback preservation remain unverified/deferred. Implementation and evidence: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-16-forgot-password-recovery.md`.
- 2026-10-16: Added the protected `/profile` page with account identity, GitHub-or-initials avatar fallback, account creation date, five user-scoped usage stats, credentials-only password changes, and accessible modal account deletion confirmation. Verified lint, TypeScript, production build, diff checks, protected redirects, live development-fixture password lifecycle, sign-out/sign-in, responsive 320px layout, keyboard focus, and no profile console errors. Account deletion was not executed; the existing dashboard crypto prerender warning remains deferred.
